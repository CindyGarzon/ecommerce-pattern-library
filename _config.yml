    typefaces.primary: |
      Baloo is a distinctive heavy spurless design with a subtle tinge of playfulness and all the bare necessities of type. Snuggling several scripts under a single weight, the typeface focuses on giving equal justice to every act of this gentle jungle affair to secure single and multi-script use. Carefree yet confident, warm yet entertaining, sprightly yet intelligible, Baloo infuses life everywhere it goes.
    typefaces.secondary: |
      Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text.
    colors.primary: |
      The primary colours represent the softness of the flowers. Should be use in the foreground.
    colors.secondary: |
      The secondary colours are more colorful, continuing with the theme of florals and should be use for background.
